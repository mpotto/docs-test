=============================
Getting started with *Sphinx*
=============================

I will be using *Sphinx* and *Read The Docs* to automatize
documentation creation and to host the documentation pages.
The convention hereafter adopted will be that of numpy. To
convert between numpydoc and the rst syntax I will be using
the napoleon package.
